# Benchmark Instances
The benchmark instances we used in our experiments came from a combination of sources, including the [SAT Competition](http://www.satcompetition.org/) and various instance generators.
We outline the benchmark instances for each category in detail here:

## Agile: 
* SAT competition 2016 and 2017
  
## Verification:
* c_bounded_model_checker from SAT Competition 2018
* industrial_combinational_equivalence from SAT Competition 2016
* tools_driven_by_sat_solvers from SAT competition 2016
* rolling instances from hardware model checking Competition 2019
  * take .aig files and unroll them with the tool [abc](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/)
  * an example of unrolling 22 times: ./abc -c "&read example.aig; &put; fold; frames -i -F 22; &get; &write_cnf example_unroll22.cnf" 
  * for each base .aig instance, we unroll it 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 times to get 11 instances
    
## Crypto:
* bitcoin_mining from SAT competition 2018
* logical_cryptanalysis_hash_function from SAT Competition 2018
* SHA1/256 preimage instances and variants
  * generated using https://github.com/saeednj/SAT-encoding
  * SHA1: we generate one instance per round from 18 rounds to 80 rounds for each of the three operators (dot_matrix, counter_chain, two_operand) supported by the generator.
  * SHA256: we generate one instance per round from 18 rounds to 64 rounds for each of the three operators (dot_matrix, counter_chain, two_operand) supported by the generator.
  * For each of the instances generated, we apply a random restrict to the input bits to SHA, we restrict from 440 bits to 510 bits with a step size of 5 bits, the intention of the restriction is to get solvable crypto instances for higher rounds.

## Random:
* k_sat_q_planted from SAT Competition 2018
* 3-CNF instances generated from cnfgen, from n=1000 to n=20000 with a step size of 50, we use cvr 4.26
* 5-CNF instances generated from cnfgen, from n=1000 to n=10000 with a step size of 50, we use cvr 21.12
* 7-CNF instances generated from cnfgen, from n=1000 to n=5200 with a step size of 50, we use cvr 87.79
