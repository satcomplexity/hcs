# Code

The full source code for our experiments is available [here](https://github.com/ChunxiaoIanLi/CDCL-proof-structural-analysis).

This repository contains the code for our [hierarchical](https://github.com/ChunxiaoIanLi/CDCL-proof-structural-analysis/tree/master/hcs-param-computation) and [non-hierarchical](https://github.com/ChunxiaoIanLi/CDCL-proof-structural-analysis/tree/master/param-computation) parameter computation tools and associated tests, [instance generator](https://github.com/ChunxiaoIanLi/CDCL-proof-structural-analysis/tree/master/hcs-generator), and [correlation experiments](https://github.com/ChunxiaoIanLi/CDCL-proof-structural-analysis/tree/master/correlation).

Our computed parameter values are available in the same repository, [here](https://github.com/ChunxiaoIanLi/CDCL-proof-structural-analysis/tree/master/correlation/datasets), while the instances we used are described [here](benchmark).
